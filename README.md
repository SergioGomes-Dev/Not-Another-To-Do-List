# Not-Another-To-Do-List
Now I know what you are thinking. Another To Do List I have seen so many of these. This is a much more complex version than what you are used to. 
There is 12 lists per profile, user authentication as well as email verification, Redux for the global state, a search functionality, a filter and priority system as well
as accessibility features. I actually use this website nearly every day and have intentions to improve and add more functionality to it. Some features I have planned 
include the ability to have items repeat by a custom amount of time, multi select for deleting and moving items between lists. As well as a sorting system.
