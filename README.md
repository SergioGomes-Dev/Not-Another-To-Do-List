# Not-Another-To-Do-List
Now I know what you are thinking. Another todo list? Iâ€™ve seen so many of these. This project is more complex than you are used to seeing. There is user authentication, email verification, redux for the global state, a backend search functionality, a filter, and a priority system as well as accessibility features. The current version was created just to get the functionality working first and thus does not have the finalized UI. I also intend to update the functionality of this site aswell as the UI. Some features I have planned include the ability to have items repeat by a custom amount of time, multi select for deleting and moving items between lists. As well as a sorting system.
